## Resovox an Artefakt Synthesizer

This is a synthesizer build using the Artefakt library.

### Getting started

```
$ cd resovox && yarn install && yarn start
```

Note: You need to allow webmidi and audio in the page settings for this to work. Click the "i" icon in the URL bar and adjust the settings. This will only work on chromium browsers since these allow webmidi
