# Artefakt - React dsp component library based on WebAudio and WebMidi (Chromium Only)

Artefakt is a component library for creating web audio-based instruments. It provides a modular audio environment that gives tone generators, effects, sequencers, and even audio visualization. It should be a simple starting point for creating web-based audio applications.

## Artefakt Core

Artefakt core provides all DSP and some UI components to quickly prototype Synthesizers and Web-Audio graphs

## Resovox

Resovox is a subtractive synthesizer that features 4 oscillators with variable waveforms feeding into a waveshaper. Filter frequency automation can be controlled through a note tracker interface. This synth is controlled via Midi. By default it will select the virtual midi port. Webmidi and audio playback need to be enabled in Chrome. Note: This synthesizer will only work in Chromium based browsers.

## SuperInterlacer

Superinterlacer is a VJ app concept that uses youtube videos and midi to sync transitions between videos.

This project is maintained by Johannes Bugiel and represents a playground for personal WebAudio/WebMidi projects. It is in early Alpha.
